                Our membership consists of graduate students and young professionals, many of whom are alumni of college a cappella groups. We rehearse one evening a week (Sundays, 6:00-8:15pm, with occasional mid-week rehearsals added on prior to performances) and usually
                hold practice in members' homes. Our repertoire is a diverse mix of Jewish, Israeli, and World music and has featured songs in English, Hebrew, Ladino, Portuguese, and Yiddish. To sign up to audition, please complete the form below. Be
                sure to scroll all the way to the end and click "Submit" to complete your application.

                        Audition slots are approximately 20 minutes and will include range checks, tonal recall exercises, and learning a sample of our repertoire. Please come prepared with a short solo to sing a cappella to the group.
