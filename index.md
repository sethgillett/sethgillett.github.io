### A programming hobbyist

```java
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
      System.out.println('Welcome to my cantina.');
  }
}
```

### Interests

**Game development** with engines like [Unity](unity3d.com), [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog), [Playcanvas](plancanvas.com), and [Blender](blender.org).

I'm interested in contributing to open source projects such as:

1. Processing
2. Scratch
3. Others

### Contact

I can be reached at `seth.gillett@gmail.com`, or just comment on any of my repositories. I don't know what the heck I'm doing so any starter guide would be very appreciated.
